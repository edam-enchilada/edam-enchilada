IMPORTING ATOFMS DATA IN BATCH

Using the ATOFMS batch loader is just like using the dialog box that you might
otherwise use to import ATOFMS data.  The fields are exactly the same:

"C:\path\to\dataset.par","c:\path\to\mass.cal","c:\path\to\size.noz",20,20,0.003

the last three fields are the peaklisting parameters: respectively, minimum
height, minimum area, and minimum relative area, for a peak to be recorded.

It should be possible to generate a file like this from MS Excel pretty easily,
or make it by hand or with a script.  Unfortunately, there are no comment lines
allowed in these files.

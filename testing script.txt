Testing Script

Installer tests:
There's no need to uninstall between every test, I think.

***** Run these with the MSDE installer but not installing MSDE, and
with the non-MSDE installer:

**Try installing with no SQL Server on the computer.
__An error message should pop up saying it couldn't find an SQL Server on 
the computer.  Installation should abort.

**Try installing with SQL Server installed but the SpASMS login not present.
__Should make the login, SpASMS/finally, with sysadmin.  Installation should
	continue as normal, and Enchilada should be able to
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles (i.e. use the tempdb database)

**Try installing with SQL Server installed and the SpASMS login present.
__should work.
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles

***** Uninstall test:

**Try uninstalling.
__should not leave behind anything in the program directory.
	also:
		__desktop icon and start menu group should be gone


***** With the MSDE installer:

**Try installing with MSDE.
__should work, and Enchilada should be able to:
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles.
	The installer:
		__Should not leave behind a directory like c:\msde-install-temp

**Try installing with MSDE with a copy of SQL Server already on the system.
__should say something informative, and abort.
		__Should not leave behind a directory like c:\msde-install-temp


Uninstall test:

**Try uninstalling.
__should not leave behind anything in the program directory.
	also:
		__desktop icon and start menu group should be gone

Testing Script

Installer tests:
There's no need to uninstall between every test, I think.

***** Run these with the MSDE installer but not installing MSDE, and
with the non-MSDE installer:

**Try installing with no SQL Server on the computer.
__An error message should pop up saying it couldn't find an SQL Server on 
the computer.  Installation should abort.
__Verify that error diagnostics appear in the "Output" window (should be
hiding behind the main Enchilada window).

**Try installing with SQL Server installed but the SpASMS login not present.
__Should make the login, SpASMS/finally, with sysadmin.  Installation should
	continue as normal, and Enchilada should be able to
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles (i.e. use the tempdb database)

**Try installing with SQL Server installed and the SpASMS login present.
__should work.
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles
		
**Install old version of Enchilada, create new database.
  Install new version of Enchilada.
__Should pop up a window warning of database incompatibility and let the user
		__1. rebuild database to create new version
		__2. quit without touching current database (so old version of Enchilada
		can run with the db)

***** Uninstall test:

**Try uninstalling.
__should not leave behind anything in the program directory.
	also:
		__desktop icon and start menu group should be gone


***** With the MSDE installer:

**Try installing with MSDE.
__should work, and Enchilada should be able to:
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles.
		__3. import atofms using a config file (i.e. opencsv made it into the jar)
	The installer:
		__Should not leave behind a directory like c:\msde-install-temp

**Try installing with MSDE with a copy of SQL Server already on the system.
__should say something informative, and abort.
		__Should not leave behind a directory like c:\msde-install-temp


Uninstall test:

**Try uninstalling.
__should not leave behind anything in the program directory.
	also:
		__desktop icon and start menu group should be gone
		

GUI tests:

**Test drop down box for viewing 1000 particles at a time
	__box works as expected
	
**Try analyzing a particle from one collection
switch the selected collection
check the next & prev buttons for 
		__correct next & prev particles
		__enabling/disabling of buttons appropriately
		__displaying a particle with a higher row number than exists in showing collection
		__spectrum view works
		__zoom in spectrum view works
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes peak in list on top right to highlight when in peak view
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes peak in list on top right to highlight when in spectrum view
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes labels to update when in peak view
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes labels to update when in spectrum view
		
		
**Try importing two collections into a single parent collection, and verify
that it works.		
	__parent collection created with children collections

**Try zooming in on time-series of only one datapoint

**Try clustering a small collection. Check that
	__clustering completes without errors
	__leaves behind subcollections for each cluster
	__creates an extra collection with cluster centroids
	__each cluster centroid can be visualized by double clicking on it
	
**Try aggregating a small collection. Check that
	__Time Basis: Selected Collection runs without errors
	__Time Basis: Times runs without errors
	
**Try "Help, About Enchilada". Check that
	__It indicates the current version

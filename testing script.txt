Testing Script

Run all the JUnit tests, making sure to enable assertions. (-ea in JVM args)

Installer tests:
There's no need to uninstall between every test, I think.

***** Run these with the MSDE installer but not installing MSDE, and
with the non-MSDE installer:

**Try installing with no SQL Server on the computer.
__An error message should pop up saying it couldn't find an SQL Server on 
the computer.  Installation should abort.

**Try installing with SQL Server installed but the SpASMS login not present.
(To do this from command line:  run osql -E and then type:
drop database SpASMSdb
go
exec sp_droplogin SpASMS
go
.)
__Should make the login, SpASMS/finally, with sysadmin.  Installation should
	continue as normal, and Enchilada should be able to
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles (i.e. use the tempdb database)

**Try installing with SQL Server installed and the SpASMS login present.
__should work.
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles
		
**Install old version of Enchilada, create new database.
  Install new version of Enchilada.
__Should pop up a window warning of database incompatibility and let the user
		__1. rebuild database to create new version
		__2. quit without touching current database (so old version of Enchilada
		can run with the db)

**Try installing with an old version of Java present.
__Should get appropriate error message.

**Try installing with Java completely uninstalled.
__Should get appropriate error message.
 

***** Uninstall test:

**Try uninstalling.
__should not leave behind anything in the program directory.
	also:
		__desktop icon and start menu group should be gone


***** With the MSDE installer:

**Try installing with MSDE.
__should work, and Enchilada should be able to:
		__1. make the database
		__2. aggregate particles.
		__3. import atofms using a config file (i.e. opencsv made it into the jar)
	The installer:
		__Should not leave behind a directory like c:\msde-install-temp

**Try installing with MSDE with a copy of SQL Server already on the system.
__should say something informative, and abort.
		__Should not leave behind a directory like c:\msde-install-temp


Uninstall test:

**Try uninstalling.
__should not leave behind anything in the program directory.
	also:
		__desktop icon and start menu group should be gone
		

GUI tests:

**Import the collections from \\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data
into one parent collection.
Actually, it should be a lot faster to do this from the external hard drive, so there would be fine.
	__parent collection created with children collections

**Try importing something that doesn't exist and something that does exist using
ATOFMS batch import.
	__correct files should import
	__should not hang or anything
	__should tell you that import failed on t'other ones (doesn't work, aug2006)

**Test Next/previous buttons in particle list
	__correct atomids appear at beginning and end of window when click
	  next/prev
	__when viewing a collection with subcollections, the correct atomids
	  appear. Check the last id from one subcollection with the first id with
	  the next subcollection and verify that these appear where they should
	  when viewing the entire collection
	
**Try analyzing a particle from one collection
switch the selected collection in the main Enchilada window (to a smaller collection)
check the next & prev buttons for 
		__correct next & prev particles
		__verify that the above still works even after the previous/next
		  buttons in the particle list have been used
		__verify that the above still works with multiple Analyze Particle
		  windows open, viewing drastically different portions of the same
		  collection or different collections
		__enabling/disabling of buttons appropriately
		__displaying a particle with a higher row number than exists in showing collection
		(Go to one of the last particles in the large collection. Switch the main
		window's selected collection to a smaller one.  Click "next" and it should
		advance without a hitch.) 
		__spectrum view works
		__zoom in spectrum view works
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes peak in list on top right to highlight when in peak view
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes peak in list on top right to highlight when in spectrum view
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes labels to update when in peak
		  view, for both positive and negative spectrum
		__highlighting peak with mouse causes labels to update when in spectrum
		  view, for both positive and negative spectrum
		__subscripts and superscripts display correctly in selected peak labels and signature views
		__Verify that the stuff ParticleAnalyzeWindow prints out appears in the "Output" window (should be hiding behind the main Enchilada window).
		__window appears properly in different sizes, as well as maximized
		__with a maximized window, click scroll bar and verify chart scrolls and refreshes appropriately
		

**Try zooming in on time-series of only one datapoint
	__zooming in works.
	__zooming in twice works.
	__zooming out works. (doesn't work for aug 2006 release) :-(

**Try zooming in on time-series of lots of points
	__zooming in between two peaks shows a line between the two peaks even though you don't see the peaks

**Try clustering a small collection. Check that
	__clustering works with these parameters:
		__By a column from sparse info (eg. Peak Area)
		__K-cluster, normalized.
		__10 clusters
		__no refined centroids
	__clustering completes without errors
	__leaves behind subcollections for each cluster
	__creates an extra collection with cluster centroids
	__each cluster centroid can be visualized by double clicking on it
**Repeat for each type of clustering.
	
**Try aggregating the small collection. Check that
	__Time Basis: Selected Collection runs without errors
	__Time Basis: Times runs without errors
	
**Try clustering the large collection with K-Means and refine centroids.
	__clustering happens.

**Try aggregating the large collection.
	__aggregation happens.
	
**Try aggregating the small and large collections together.
	__aggregation happens.

**Try cancel button in aggregation dialog before aggregating the small and large collections together.
	__cancel works.
	
**Try aggregating the small and large collections together with a 'time series' collection(EC, BC, hg0).
	__aggregation happens and they end up within the same aggregation collection.

**Try deleting, renaming, etc collections, make sure everything looks right.
	__ different length renames work
	__ after a delete the label in the upper right should change to "Currently showing 0 particles"
	
**Try "Help, About Enchilada". Check that
	__It indicates the current version
	
**Import time series data: (small.task should work, upload.task is SLOOOOOOW!!)
	__import a task file (\\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\\timeseries) that works
		__works
	__import a task file (\\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\\timeseries) that doesn't work
		__no hard crashes
		__useful error messages
	__import a csv file (\\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\\timeseries\\CSV) that works
		__works
	__import a csv file (\\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\\timeseries\\CSV) that doesn't work
		__no hard crashes
		__useful error messages
	
**Import AMS data from \\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\\ams
Choose Nitrate_MS.txt, t_series.txt, amus.txt for the first row, and
	   Sulfate_MS.txt, t_series.txt, amus.txt for the second. Verify that:
	__AMS data imports successfully
	__Progress bar properly indicates progress and dataset number for each import
Choose the same files as above, selecting "import into parent collection" in the import dialog.
	Pick a name and description, and verify that:
	__AMS data imports successfully
	__All data is imported into the chosen parent collection
	
**Import SPASS data from \\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\spass
Choose SPASS_JRC.txt for the first row, and SPASS_JRC_Zeros.txt for the second.
   Verify that:
	__SPASS data imports successfully
	__Progress bar properly indicates progress and dataset number for each import
Choose the same files as above, selecting "import into parent collection" in the import dialog.
	Pick a name and description, and verify that:
	__SPASS data imports successfully
	__All data is imported into the chosen parent collection	
	
**Test Analyze->Query
	__ATOFMS data works on everything
	__AMS/SPASS data won't let you query size
	
**Try analyzing a particle from a SPASS collection. Verify that:
	__"Next" and "Prev" buttons work and display the correct particles
	__Peaks look correct (1 peak at m/z 23 for the first particle in SPASS_JRC.txt
	__Clicking the Spectrum radio button errors gracefully (since this is considered ATOFMS)
	__Zooming, highlighting, etc. works as expected.
	
**Try analyzing a particle from an AMS collection. Verify that
	__"Next" and "Prev" buttons work and display the correct particles
	__Correct peaks are present (at locations m/z 14, 30, 31, 32, 46, 47, 48, and 63 for items from Nitrate_MS.txt)
	__Multiple analyze windows can be opened simultaneously on different collections
	__Spectrum view button is not present
	__Highlighting peaks selects peak in peak list, provides peak label information
	__Zooming in and out works correctly
	
<NO LONGER RELEVANT>
**Try to import an existing datatype in the metadata format.  
	__Use \\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\test data\AMS.md
(Note that this is not a complete .md file - just enough to catch the problem.)
Enchilada should pop up a message informing the user that the datatype name is already in use.
	__Use \\collab.its.carleton.edu\COLLAB\Projects\EDAM\Presentation data\SimpleParticle.md
	and simpleData.ed
		__Creating new metadata works
		__Importing data works
</NO LONGER RELEVANT>
	
Check the Task manager for extra javaw.exe's running.  If there are some, then
something's wrong.

**Import Switzerland. Verify that imports in less than a couple of days.

**Test File->New empty collection.
	__ Make sure it works and can copy particles in
	__ Make sure that if you leave out a name, error is handled properly
	__ Make sure that if you leave out datatpe, error is handled properly
